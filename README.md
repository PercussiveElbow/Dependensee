Dependensee is an open source patch/vulnerability manager for third party libraries

It can keep track of libraries used in your projects and will report any CVEs those libraries are vulnerable to, providing links, CVE information, reports and PoC exploits where avaliable.

Dependency files can be uploaded by either the API, or by using the UI.

Current language support:
<a href="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-ruby-red.svg"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-ruby-red.svg"/></a>
<a href="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-java-blue.svg"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-java-blue.svg"/></a>
<a href="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg"/></a>

It consists of three parts:
- Rails server to store and manage your dependencies. This exposes a REST API
- *(Optional)* Ruby client to automatically scan projects on disk.
- *(Optional)* UI powered by VueJS

## Demo
https://dependensee.tech

## Run it yourself (Requires Docker+Docker Compose)
Download latest <a href="https://github.com/PercussiveElbow/Dependensee/releases" >release</a> and export a RAILS_SECRET to your shell (must contain both letters and numbers). Then run:
```bash
docker-compose -f dependensee_release.yml up
```
The API can then be hit on localhost:3000, or alternatively the UI can be accessed on localhost:80

## API Documentation
https://dependensee.tech/docs

Or when you're running the server locally simply hit localhost:3000/docs
