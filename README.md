Dependensee is an open source patch/vulnerability manager for third party libraries

It keeps track of libraries used in your projects and reports any CVEs they are vulnerable to, providing links, CVE information, reports and PoC exploits where avaliable.

Current language support:

<a href="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-java-blue.svg"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-java-blue.svg"/></a>
<a href="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-green.svg"/></a>

It consists of three parts:
- Rails server to store/manage your dependencies. This exposes a REST API
- *(Optional)* Ruby client to automatically scan projects.
- *(Optional)* UI powered by VueJS
